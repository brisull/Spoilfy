# Spoilfy
This program aims to build a lifetime-persistant personal favorites/collections/history management system in music,
as a supplementary solution to the "isolated" media platforms like Spotify and iTunes.
The core idea to achieve this is to build a unified Mapper database which maps music information across multiple media platforms with the support of APIs of Spotify and MusicBrainz.
The goal is to build a music focused Personal Cloud that differs to Owncloud/Plex/SeaFile.
