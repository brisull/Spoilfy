The first thing i'd like to do is, create the sturcture of databases, and try to pull WebAPIs and insert data into databases.

The steps are as below:
- [x] Design database schemas
- [ ] Create databases
    - [ ] User Library
        - [ ] User tables
        - [ ] Mapping tables
        - [ ] Files tables
    - [ ] Public Library
        - [ ] Spotify Library
        - [ ] MusicBrainz Library
- [ ] Spotify API
    - [ ] Authentication (OAuth2.0 in Python)
    - [ ] Retrieve data from API
    - [ ] Save data to database
- [ ] MusicBrainz API
    - [ ] Authentication (OAuth2.0 in Python)
    - [ ] Retrieve data from API
    - [ ] Save data to database

After the steps above are done, it's to RE-FACTOR code structure with proper Design Patterns.
